		<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging</h1>
		

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge:</h2>
				<p>We were tasked with debugging a previous lab, we choose lab 10, because we were having difficulty with making the function in Javascript work.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems:</h2>
				<p>There was a problem, we had no clue how to fix this! We even had to ask Ilia.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection:</h2>
				<p> This lab was difficult, but also one of our favorite parts of coding is the challenge and puzzle of decoding. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results:</h2>
				<p> We realized we had not even put the work that the function needed to be doing in the function feild! This was monumental, and made the code work instantly </p>
