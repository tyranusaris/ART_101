			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving </h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>We were challenged to make comments from our psudocode of a existing easy game. We choose Wordle.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We ran into the problem of disecting the code from it's broader language, into more specific coding langauge. However, we looked at the examples on canvas and figured it out.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results:</h2>
						<pre>
							<code>
								<p>
									// 1. Choose a random 5-letter word in the english dictionary
										//choose a random 5 letter word from a predefined list of valid 5 letter words in the english dictionary, save in a container called word of the day
									// 2. Print a QWERTY keyboard
										//print a functional keyboard with each character displaying the correct color indicator
											//correct character; green
											//incorrect character; dark grey
											//untested character; light grey
									// 3. Print a 5x6 empty word grid (5 letters and 6 guesses)
										//loop through 6 rows
											//loop through 5 columns
												//print either a empty box or letter guessed with saved correct color indicators
									// 4. Accept user input (5-letter guess)
										//accept 5 letters into the row of empty boxes
											//run guess when user presses enter on keyboard 
									// 5. Validate that the guess is in the english dictionary
										//check if the guess exists in the predefined list of valid 5 letter words in the english dictionary
											//if guess does not exist in the predefined list 
												//empty the row 
												//loop back to step 4
									// 6. & 7.  Compare guess word to target word
										//loop through each letter of guess in the row
											//if the letter exists in the word of the day, and is in the right spot
												//fill box green, and display letter
											//if the letter exists in the word of the day, but is not in the right spot
												//fill box yellow, and display letter
											// if the letter does not exist in the target word
												// fill box light grey, and display letter
									// 8. & 9. Test win or lose (out-of-guesses) condition, otherwise go back to step 2
										// If guess does not match the word of the day, and less than 6 guesses have been made
											//go back to step 2
										// If guess does not match the word of the day, and 6 guesses have been made
											// print all 5 letters in their correct color indicator
											// print you lose and the word of the day is displayed at the top of screen 
										//If guess matches word of the day
											//print all 5 letters in green
											//print you won!
